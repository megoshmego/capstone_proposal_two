Project Proposal for Capstone Ideas
Introduction:
This document outlines Capstone Two per Springboard requirements.



=PaceSync - Music and Running Tempo App

Tech Stack: React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Spotify API for music data.
Focus: This is a full-stack application with a slight emphasis on the frontend to ensure a seamless and engaging user interaction experience.
Platform: Website.
Goal: To allow runners to sync their running pace with music tempo, enhancing their running experience by automatically adjusting music speed in real-time.
User Demographic: Targeted towards fitness enthusiasts who enjoy running and music, particularly those who like to use music as a motivational tool during workouts.
Data Usage: Utilizes the Spotify API to fetch songs and manipulate playback speed based on the userâ€™s running tempo. Users can exclude specific musical genres and use a shuffle feature to maintain song variety within the desired tempo range.
Approach:
Database Schema: User profiles, settings for music preferences.
API Challenges: Handling API rate limits and ensuring seamless playback across different devices.
Sensitive Information: User account information and preferences will be securely stored.
Functionality: Adjustable tempo control, music genre filtering, and optional shuffle on tempo.
User Flow: Users sign up, set preferences, start a running session, and music plays. Adjustments can be made via an input stepper-like interface.
Stretch Goals: Integrate with wearable devices to automatically detect pace changes.
